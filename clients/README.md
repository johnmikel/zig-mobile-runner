# ZMR Language Clients

ZMR clients are small wrappers around the same newline-delimited JSON-RPC
protocol exposed by:

```bash
zmr serve --transport stdio --config .zmr/config.json --trace-dir traces/zmr-agent
```

They are intended for AI agents, CI harnesses, and app teams that want typed
or idiomatic calls without reimplementing JSON-RPC framing.
Each client includes `devices()` for `device.list`, including the portable
`ready` boolean, and a semantic snapshot helper for `observe.semanticSnapshot`
so agents can work from normalized roles, selectors, bounds, and recommended
actions instead of raw platform hierarchy classes.
The TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust clients expose the same core control
surface: session lifecycle, app launch/stop/link/state, snapshot and semantic
snapshot, tap/type/erase/hide-keyboard/swipe/back/scroll, waits, assertions,
trace event polling, and trace export.
Use the `assertHealthy`/`assert_healthy` helper after launches, links, and major
navigation steps to catch native crash overlays and development-client failures
without hand-maintaining negative selectors in every client.

For install commands across package managers, see
[docs/client-installation.md](../docs/client-installation.md).

## TypeScript

Runtime: `clients/typescript/index.mjs`
Types: `clients/typescript/index.d.ts`

```bash
node clients/typescript/examples/fake-session.mjs
```

```js
import { createZmrClient } from "./clients/typescript/index.mjs";

const zmr = createZmrClient({
  command: "zmr",
  args: ["serve", "--transport", "stdio", "--config", ".zmr/config.json"],
});
```

## Python

Runtime: `clients/python/zmr_client.py`

```bash
python3 -m pip install "git+https://github.com/johnmikel/zig-mobile-runner.git#subdirectory=clients/python"
```

```bash
python3 clients/python/examples/fake_session.py
```

```python
from zmr_client import ZmrClient

with ZmrClient("zmr", ["serve", "--transport", "stdio", "--config", ".zmr/config.json"]) as zmr:
    snapshot = zmr.snapshot()
```

## Go

Runtime: `clients/go/zmr/client.go`

```bash
go get github.com/johnmikel/zig-mobile-runner/clients/go@main
```

```bash
go run ./clients/go/examples/fake-session \
  --zmr ./zig-out/bin/zmr \
  --adb ./tests/fake-adb.sh \
  --trace-dir traces/demo-go-client
```

```go
client, err := zmr.Start(ctx, "zmr", "serve", "--transport", "stdio", "--config", ".zmr/config.json")
```

## Rust

Runtime: `clients/rust/src/lib.rs`

Cargo packages library code from `src/lib.rs` by convention. Because this repo
is not yet published as a Rust crate, consume the client from a local checkout:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/johnmikel/zig-mobile-runner.git vendor/zig-mobile-runner
```

```toml
[dependencies]
zmr-client = { path = "vendor/zig-mobile-runner/clients/rust" }
```

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path clients/rust/Cargo.toml --example fake_session -- \
  --zmr ./zig-out/bin/zmr \
  --adb ./tests/fake-adb.sh \
  --trace-dir traces/demo-rust-client
```

```rust
let mut client = zmr_client::Client::start("zmr", ["serve", "--transport", "stdio", "--config", ".zmr/config.json"])?;
let snapshot = client.snapshot()?;
```

## Swift

Runtime: `clients/swift/Sources/ZMRClient/ZMRClient.swift`

Use the Swift client from a local SwiftPM package path until it is published as
a standalone Swift package:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/johnmikel/zig-mobile-runner.git vendor/zig-mobile-runner
```

```swift
.package(path: "vendor/zig-mobile-runner/clients/swift")
```

Swift is useful for macOS host-side automation next to iOS app code. It is not
an SDK embedded in the app under test.

## Kotlin

Runtime: `clients/kotlin/src/main/kotlin/dev/zmr/ZmrClient.kt`

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/johnmikel/zig-mobile-runner.git vendor/zig-mobile-runner
gradle -p vendor/zig-mobile-runner/clients/kotlin build
```

Kotlin is useful for Android teams that want host-side orchestration in Kotlin.
It still drives the external `zmr` binary.

Rust has `src/lib.rs` because Cargo packages libraries from that path by
convention. The other clients use the equivalent idiomatic layout for their
ecosystem: ESM entry file for TypeScript, a pip-installable Python module, a Go
package directory, a SwiftPM package, and a Gradle/Kotlin source package.
