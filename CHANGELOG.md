- `schemas/validate-output.schema.json` for the machine-readable `zmr validate --json` preflight result.
- Stable public error-code mapping for CLI/protocol-facing failures.

- Demo documentation in `docs/demo.md`.
- Release evidence checklist in `docs/release-evidence.md` mapping product
  claims to concrete commands and required artifacts.
- Machine-readable protocol compatibility metadata in `runner.capabilities`.
- Go and Rust reference JSON-RPC clients with fake-session examples and CI
  coverage.
- Go and Rust clients now expose the full core mobile control surface for
  session lifecycle, app lifecycle, UI actions, waits, assertions, semantic
  snapshots, trace polling, and trace export.
- Go and Rust fake-session examples now launch `zmr serve` with the fake-device
  backend and exercise agent-style open-link, wait, tap, type, assertion,
  snapshot, trace polling, and redacted export flows.
- `zmr-benchmark-command` for timing app-local baseline commands and writing
  normalized rows that can be compared with ZMR benchmark results.
- `zmr-benchmark --results` / `--replace` for appending ZMR runs to a shared
  comparison JSONL file.
- `zmr-compare-benchmarks` gates for candidate pass rate, failure count, mean
  speedup, and p95 speedup.

  Swift, and Kotlin.
- SwiftPM and Kotlin/JVM reference clients for host-side native mobile team
  automation.
- Swift and Kotlin fake-session demo entry points now run from `scripts/demo.sh`
  and export redacted traces alongside the TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust
  client demos.
- Kotlin/JVM client calls now reject JSON-RPC error responses instead of
  returning error payloads as successful raw strings.
- `scripts/release-candidate.sh` now generates release-candidate evidence in
  local, hardware, or combined modes from a source checkout.
- Hardware release-candidate evidence rows now include structured thresholds,
  app root, app id, app artifact, and device identifiers for readiness checks.
- The npm package keeps `zmr-release-readiness` for app-local evidence checks
  but does not expose maintainer-only release-candidate tooling as an app
  install command.
- `zmr-release-readiness` / `scripts/release-readiness.sh` now converts
  release-candidate `evidence.jsonl` into explicit dev-preview, production,
  or market-claim readiness decisions with missing evidence listed for agents
  and maintainers.
- `schemas/release-readiness-output.schema.json` and `zmr schemas --json`
  metadata for agent-readable release evidence gate output.
- `zmr-release-readiness --json` now includes `nextSteps` commands for missing
  evidence so agents can continue blocked release gates without scraping text.
- `zmr-release-readiness --json` now includes per-requirement status rows so
  agents can see which evidence satisfied a release claim and which evidence
  was missing, failed, planned, or insufficient.
- Market-claim readiness now rejects benchmark evidence that does not prove the
  documented pass-rate, zero-failure, mean-speedup, and p95-speedup thresholds.
- `zmr-compare-benchmarks` now supports `--evidence-out` so competitive
  benchmark comparisons can append market-claim readiness evidence directly.
- `zmr-assert-ios-physical-ready` now accepts `--xcrun`, and
  `zmr-pilot-gate` forwards custom `--xcrun` paths into the physical iOS
  readiness preflight as well as the iOS pilot run.
- `zmr-pilot-gate` now accepts `--zmr-bin` and forwards the explicit runner
  binary to Android, iOS, and physical iOS readiness checks for app-local CI.
- `zmr-pilot-gate` now records structured app-root and iOS app-artifact
  evidence, and iOS pilots require `--ios-app-root` so production-readiness
  evidence names the tested app source and build.
- Local release-candidate evidence now runs the generated public iOS simulator
  demo five times by default, with `--local-ios-demo-runs <n>` for explicit
  release-candidate tuning.
- Local release-candidate evidence can now run the generated public Android
  emulator demo with `--local-android-avd <name>`, `--local-android-device`,
  and `--local-android-demo-runs <n>`.
- `scripts/assert-ios-physical-ready.sh` now makes release-candidate hardware
  mode fail unless the requested physical iOS device is present and ready, with
  retries for transient CoreDevice list failures.
- `zmr doctor` now keeps physical iOS checks actionable on multi-device
  machines by reporting disconnected/unavailable device counts even when one
  physical device is ready.
- `zmr doctor --json` now emits structured `count` and `readyCount` fields for
  Android, iOS simulator, and physical iOS device checks so agents do not need
  to parse human-readable detail strings.
- Physical iOS discovery and lifecycle support through `xcrun devicectl`,
  including install, launch, deep-link launch, clear-state uninstall, and
  best-effort stop.

- Physical iOS device discovery now exposes the commandable CoreDevice
  identifier from `devicectl` as the `serial` value agents pass back to
  `--device`, with the hardware UDID retained only as a parser fallback.
- `scripts/run-ios-pilot.sh --ios-device-type physical` now rejects listed but
  disconnected/unavailable physical device identifiers before install with
  `setup.ios.physical_device_not_ready` and prints the matched device state.
- `zmr doctor --json` now includes stable setup `errorCode` values for missing tools, failed tool commands, and missing shim commands.

- `zmr validate --json` now reports missing `openLink.url` values as `scenario.invalid` with `fieldPath: "$.steps[].url"`.
- `zmr validate --json` now reports missing `typeText.text` values as `scenario.invalid` with `fieldPath: "$.steps[].text"`.
- `zmr validate --json` now reports missing `swipe.x1`, `swipe.y1`, `swipe.x2`, and `swipe.y2` values as `scenario.invalid` with field-specific `fieldPath` values.

### Changed

- README now links to install, demo, schema, and roadmap materials.
- Protocol documentation now includes concrete request/response examples and error shapes.
- Protocol versioning now defines the pre-`v1.0.0` compatibility contract and breaking-change policy.
- Android `openLink` now avoids blocking `am start -W`, retries when Android leaves the launcher foregrounded, and lets selector waits absorb transient observation command timeouts.
- iOS simulators are supported for lifecycle, snapshots, logs, deep links,
  clear-state-by-uninstall, and selector-driven XCTest shim interaction.
- iOS XCTest shim commands now retry once when Xcode/CoreSimulator reports a
  transient server bootstrap failure, reducing fresh-simulator flake while
  preserving immediate failures for real command and assertion errors.
- Physical iOS devices are supported for local lifecycle and selector-grade
  XCTest shim interaction. Screenshot artifacts use the XCTest shim; log
  capture remains simulator-first.
- npm package contents now exclude internal test sources, caches, traces, and
  build outputs while keeping runtime source, prebuilds, docs, examples, shims,
  schemas, viewer assets, release scripts, and language clients available.
- Shipped TypeScript and Rust client metadata now matches the runner
  `0.1.0-dev.1` prerelease, with package tests guarding future drift.

### Known Limitations

- Physical iOS log capture is not complete yet.
- Broad cloud-device-farm certification is not included in this dev-preview
  release.
- Real app benchmark claims should be made from private app-local
  `zmr-compare-benchmarks` reports, not from generic public fixtures.

## 0.1.0-dev.1

Initial local dev preview:

- Zig CLI and JSON-RPC runner.
- Android ADB/UI Automator adapter.
- iOS simulator lifecycle, snapshots, logs, deep links, and selector-driven
  XCTest shim preview.
- Scenario runner with waits, assertions, selectors, retries, and trace writing.
- Fake-device test harness and no-emulator demo.
- Release archive script and CI workflows.
