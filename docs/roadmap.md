# ZMR Product Roadmap

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development or superpowers:executing-plans to implement roadmap tasks task-by-task. Keep TDD active, preserve the 90% coverage gate, and do not regress the fake-device demo.

**Goal:** Make Zig Mobile Runner a shippable open-source mobile test runner for AI agents, with Android production support first and iOS production support next.

**Product Thesis:** ZMR should feel like Playwright for mobile agents: fast typed control, rich observations, deterministic traces, and reliable isolation. It should beat shell-driven mobile automation by moving orchestration, waits, retries, traces, and protocol handling into a small Zig core while delegating platform-specific state and interaction to focused native adapters.

**Current State:** `0.1.0-dev` local dev preview. Android pilot flows exist. iOS simulator lifecycle, snapshot, and selector actions are supported through `simctl` plus the XCTest shim. Coverage gate is above 90%. Demo traces can be generated without an emulator.

---

## Definition Of Shippable

ZMR is shippable when a new developer can install it, run the no-device demo, connect an Android emulator, run the Android pilot wrapper, connect a booted iOS simulator, run the iOS smoke wrapper, inspect actionable traces, and integrate an external AI agent through JSON-RPC without manual code changes or hidden setup.

The first public product should be a **developer preview**, not a broad device-farm platform. It should be honest about limitations and strong on repeatability.

## Product Principles

- **Typed agent protocol first:** agents should consume structured snapshots and action results, not parse terminal output.
- **Deterministic traces:** every run should leave enough evidence to debug failure without rerunning immediately.
- **Fast local loop:** fake-device tests, fake demos, and simulator/emulator flows must run locally.
- **Adapter boundaries:** Android, iOS, and future platforms should share runner semantics without sharing platform hacks.
- **No embedded LLM:** ZMR is the control plane; external agents decide.
- **Security by default:** persisted JSON traces redact common secrets; publishing real visual artifacts requires explicit sanitizer work.

## Release Tracks

- `docs/protocol.md` documents every JSON-RPC method, params, response shape, and error shape.
- `docs/shipping.md` has one copy-paste release gate.
- `scripts/demo.sh` passes on a clean macOS machine with Zig and no emulator.
- `scripts/coverage.sh` stays at or above 90%.
- Release archives include binary, README, license, protocol docs, demo scenarios, checksum file, and verifier.

Work:
- [x] Add `zmr doctor` to detect Zig, ADB, `xcrun`, emulator/simulator state, Android SDK paths, and missing permissions.
- [x] Add `zmr init` to scaffold a starter scenario.
- [x] Add stable JSON schemas for scenario files, snapshots, action results, and JSON-RPC payloads.

- `zig test src/main.zig -target aarch64-macos.15.0`
- `./scripts/demo.sh`
- `./scripts/coverage.sh`
- `./scripts/build-release.sh`

### Track B: Android Production Adapter

Purpose: move Android from useful pilot to product-grade reliability.

Ship criteria:
- Android sample app auth probe and login smoke flows pass repeatedly on a clean emulator.
- Failure traces identify selector misses, active package/activity, visible text, screenshots, logs, and timing.
- A native Android shim can provide hierarchy and interaction when ADB shell/UI Automator is too slow or flaky.
- Runner can install, launch, stop, clear state, deep link, tap, type, swipe, press back, wait, assert, and snapshot reliably.

Work:
- [x] Add Android shim project under `shims/android/`.
- [x] Implement faster hierarchy retrieval through Android accessibility/UI Automator APIs.
- [x] Implement reliable tap/type/swipe through the shim with ADB shell fallback.
- [x] Add app idle/settle detection instead of fixed sleeps where possible.
- [x] Add local emulator helper script for boot, wait-ready, snapshot save/load, and kill.
- [x] Add in-run emulator lifecycle orchestration: create, boot, wait-ready, reset, snapshot restore.
  - [x] Pilot wrapper can reset the target emulator and boot an AVD from a named snapshot.
  - [x] `zmr run` can boot an AVD, restore a snapshot, reset, and wait-ready before scenario execution.
  - [x] `zmr run` can create a missing AVD from an installed Android system image.
- [x] Add Android artifact capture: screenshot, hierarchy, logcat window, package/activity, display metrics, optional screen recording.
  - [x] Pilot wrapper can capture an optional MP4 screen recording for visual flake triage.
  - [x] Snapshots include Android display density when available.
  - [x] Traced Android runs can capture opt-in MP4 screen recordings.
- [x] Add Android flake harness that repeats pilot scenarios and emits pass rate/duration summaries.

Acceptance:
- `examples/android-app-auth-probe.json` passes 20/20 local runs.
- `examples/android-app-login-smoke.json` passes 20/20 local runs.
- Repeated-run reports show stable pass rate, useful failure diagnostics, and acceptable runtime on a clean emulator.
- All Android adapter unit/fake tests pass without an emulator.

### Track C: iOS Production Adapter

Purpose: keep the iOS simulator adapter at agent-grade quality and expand the supported surface deliberately.

Ship criteria:
- iOS supports structured hierarchy, selector matching, tap, type, swipe, press home/back-equivalent navigation, launch, stop, clear state, deep link, screenshot, logs, and snapshots.
- iOS implementation uses XCTest/XCUIAutomation boundaries instead of fragile coordinate-only shelling.
- iOS simulator smoke flow runs with the same scenario semantics as Android where platform concepts overlap.

Work:
- [x] Create app-local XCTest shim source and installer under `shims/ios/`.
- [x] Define a small local shim protocol for hierarchy, element query, tap, type, swipe, keyboard, and app state.
- [x] Add Zig-side iOS shim command and snapshot mapping tests.
- [x] Add Zig-side iOS shim process control for one-command local shim execution.
- [x] Map XCUIElement snapshots into `UiNode` with stable ids, labels, identifiers, values, enabled/visible flags, and bounds.
- [x] Add iOS selector tests using fake shim responses.
- [x] Add real simulator E2E smoke scenario with install/launch/openLink/snapshot/tap/type using the generated XCTest shim.
- [x] Decide and document iOS clear-state semantics: best-effort app uninstall by bundle id; a missing app is already clean.

Acceptance:
- `examples/ios-smoke.json` passes on a real booted simulator with a test app.
- At least one selector-driven iOS flow passes repeatedly without manual interaction.
- iOS unsupported-action errors disappear for normal UI actions.
- iOS traces include screenshot, hierarchy, logs, active app id, timings, and assertions.

## Open Decisions

- Should the Android native shim be an APK, instrumentation test APK, or long-running local service?
- Should the trace viewer be bundled as static files or shipped as a separate package?
- Should public SDKs live in this repo or separate repos once protocol stabilizes?
- What exact compatibility promise should `protocolVersion` make before `v1.0.0`?
